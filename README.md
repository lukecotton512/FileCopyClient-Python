# FileCopyClient - Python
By: Luke Cotton

## What is FileCopyClient?
FileCopyClient is the client of two programs I like to call FileCopy. FileCopy will allow you to send files back and forth between two systems on a network. Another program, called FileCopyServer, is the server. This version of the client is written in Python.

## How to use
To run, just use:
```
python3 FileCopyClient.py <server> <path to file>
```
Where server is the ```server``` you want to connect to, and ```path to file``` is the file you want to send.
